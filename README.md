## Transcriptome analysis of *Aspergillus fumigatus* Chr7 aneuploids exposed to FK506

This repository contains code used for the transcriptome analysis and associated figure generation in: \
\
Lehmann AE, Ramírez EA, Keller NP, Heitman J. Whole-chromosome duplications drive antimicrobial resistance in *Aspergillus fumigatus*.
2025. \
\
It includes steps to: \
  • Trim and align RNA-seq reads to the A1163 reference genome. \
  • Quantify feature abundances from aligned reads. \
  • Identify differentially expressed genes. \
  • Generate Figure 2*A-D*, Figure S1, Figure S2, and Table S2.
